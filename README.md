# Technology Orientation
Since Lambda School is an online school for training software developers it is expected that you will have advanced skills in using and troubleshooting applications. 

At the end of this module you should be able to:
* Install all necessary applications and accessories (speakers/microphone/webcam) to fully participate in Lambda School classes.
* Install applications on your mobile device to ensure you can communicate during an emergency.
* Know how to navigate and communicate using Slack.
* Know how to access and participate fully and professionally in Zoom.
* Know how to access and navigate Training Kit.
* Know how to access and navigate the Progress Report Dashboard.
* Know how to access and ask a question in Frontdesk.
* Know how to use any applications presented during the pre-work for your track. 

## System Requirements

* Minimum
 1.6 GHz Processor
 4 GB RAM (8 GB of RAM for the iOS course)
 120 GB Hard Drive
 Web Cam
 Microphone
* Recommended
 2 GHz Processor
 8 GB RAM
 256 GB Hard Drive (preferably solid state)

Recommended operating systems (in descending order): macOS, Windows 10, Ubuntu. For UX and iOS, macOS is heavily encouraged. For iOS, Mojave 10.14 is required.

Other versions of Windows work but students should anticipate occasional environment issues. Chromebooks are *not* supported, as coursework involves installing and running software locally.

_Does your current system meet these standards?_

### Webcam
An external webcam or built-in camera on your computer is recommended to be able to share video with your classmates. It is easier to communicate when you can see nonverbal communication like facial expressions. High definition and feature rich webcams are unnecessary and the basic models will cost approximately $25. 

### Microphone
Some laptops have on-board microphones but it is preferable to have an external microphone. This way it can be positioned properly to ensure your classmates and instructors can hear you clearly. A simple external microphone can be purchased for under $20, with better sound quality coming at higher prices. A headset or headphones with attached microphone also work for this purpose.

### Speakers-Headset-Headphones
The video content does have audio that you will need to listen to. Depending on your study area it may be helpful to have a headset or headphones. 

### Mobile devices
The main communication tools used at Lambda- Slack, Zoom and Notion have mobile applications. If you have a mobile device it would be useful to download these applications to be sure you can communicate in an emergency. The vast majority of the work can not be completed on a mobile device and a fully functional system is required. 

## Technology Skills Prerequisites
It is assumed that you are able to do the following technology tasks as a Lambda School student. If there are any you need to work on, look for online tutorials and brush up on your skills.

* Conduct an effective search with a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) using advanced search commands.
* Evaluate web resources for authority, currency, purpose, and content.
* Understanding copyrights, licenses, and plagiarism in a digital environment.
* Install software.
* Update software.
* Run virus and malware scans.
* Save and retrieve files.
* Ability to create folders/directories.
* Ability to bookmark web pages for future reference.
* Ability to play audio and video files.
* Familiarity with a word processing, spreadsheet and database program.
* Familiarity with a computer operating system (Windows, Linux or MacOS).
* Have and use an email account.
* Ability to send and receive email attachments.
* Ability to troubleshoot basic technology issues.

## Accessibility and Privacy Policies
It is Lambda School's intention to make you aware of accessibility tools and understand the privacy policies of the apps that we frequently use since they are from third party vendors. It is recommended that you review their accessibility and privacy policies.

## Slack 

Slack is an online communication tool used widely in the tech industry. For Lambda School, it is the most important and frequent way we communicate with students. If you’ve never used Slack before, get to know it well. Nearly every company in Silicon Valley uses it, and it’s rapidly becoming a point of competence across software engineering teams.

[What is Slack?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g)

Slack is a collaboration hub where you will communicate with everyone at Lambda School. Slack is used because of the following benefits and features not provided by an email system;
* Organized conversations
* Searchable history
* Apps and integrations
Slack can be used in a browser, as a desktop app and as a mobile app. 
It is vitally important that you are on Slack every school day at Lambda. 

### Slack at Lambda School
* You will be placed in a Slack channel with the other students in your program. The instructor will interact with you in this slack channel. They will post lecture links to their Zoom rooms, answer questions and post additional resources. 

* Once you’ve filled out your confirmation form, you will be added to the student Slack workspace and assigned to a few main channels depending on your class and group.

* _Example: You are a new student joining the WEB18 class (Full Stack Web, Class 18), your main Slack channels will be #WEB18 and #WEB18_help. You will be assigned to a smaller group with your Project Manager. For example, if your Project Manager is Alicia Jackson, that Slack channel might be named #WEB18_aj._

* Lambda School instructors have a white Lambda School logo over a red background and project managers have black Lambda School logo over a white background next to their usernames. Other Lambda School staff have white Lambda School logo over a black background next to their usernames.


### Tips for Using Slack 
* When setting your Slack avatar, use a professional profile photo, just as you would for a job. Also, use your first and last name on your profile. 

* The #WEB# help channel is the first place you should post if you are confused or stuck. A PM or Instructor will jump in and help you work through the challenge at hand.

* When it is time for a lecture, a Zoom link will be posted in your class channel with the @channel tag, which should send you both desktop and push notifications. Make sure to follow the schedule and be on time for those lectures, as your class may not wait for you.

* Typing a message in Slack that includes “@here” or “@channel” notifies everyone in that channel. This sends an alert to their desktop, or, in many cases, their personal cellphones. As such, please use “@here” and ”@channel” sparingly in your cohort or local channels, and not in general channels. Thanks for helping us keep Slack usable!

## Zoom 
Zoom is the leader in modern enterprise video communications, with an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, chat, and webinars across mobile devices, desktops, telephones, and room systems. While at Lambda School you’ll use Zoom to receive lectures, pair program, work on your group projects, and receive 1:1 support from the Instruction team, and more!

### Tips for Being a Professional in a Zoom Meeting
* If you are not speaking set your microphone to mute. But, be sure to toggle it on when it is your time to speak.
* When your microphone is on be aware of distracting noises. If using an onboard microphone on a laptop using your keyboard will be very loud to other Zoom participants. Little things like cell phone buzzers, the noise of your microphone rubbing on your shirt collar or a squeaky office chair can be enough to distract your audience.  
* Shut out your most distracting house mates. If you have a child, a dog, a cat, a guinea pig, or any other animal that can get loud or "needy" at times, they’re probably going to want to be involved in your conversations as soon as they hear you talking to the cool people on the other side of the monitor. It’s best to just leave them out of the room while the meeting’s going on.
* Be camera ready. If possible before the meeting have a look at yourself on webcam. You might notice that the webcam is pointed at your forehead, your lighting makes it difficult to see you or you have something distracting in your background. If your lighting is behind you, people will only see a silhouette. Make sure that any light coming towards your face is stronger than the light behind you. Wear a nice shirt. From your Mac or PC, just click “Settings” on your Zoom client, and then “Video” to see what you look like before you join the meeting.
* There’s a lot to be said about video meeting etiquette regarding eating and drinking. If you’re grabbing a cup of tea or some bottled water, that’s acceptable, or at least more acceptable than slurping spaghetti during your meeting.
* Before you invite others into the kingdom of your computer, it would be wise to eliminate any possible occasion for distraction during the screen sharing session. This means closing social networks, messaging applications, and anything that pops up or flashes while you’re trying to present something. 
* Use a webcam and allow your classmates to see you on video. Video conferencing is more engaging and allows you to make virtual eye contact with your classmates, project managers and instructors. Humans process visual information far faster and more capably than text or audio, so it will also increase your ability to communicate and learn.

## Training Kit
The Lambda School Training Kit is the home for all learning resources at Lambda School. You can access Training Kit at http://learn.lambdaschool.com/. You will be given login credentials to access this site. The curriculum is constantly evolving to ensure you’re armed with the latest technologies. You will always have access to the materials in this training kit, even after you graduate. 

Each track is organized into sections with clearly outlined objectives. These objectives describe what you should be able to do after completing the lesson. The _Prepare_ section will provide videos, website resources and text that should be read before the lecture. The _Learn_ section is the content that will be covered in the lecture by your instructor and is also there as a resource when you are working on your projects. Then near the end will be the _Projects_ section which is where you will find information about the projects you'll be working on in the afternoon. Finally, there is the _Review_ Section that will detail the specific requirements to demonstrate mastery during your code review. There are navigation buttons across the top of the Training Kit that will allow you to jump to each of these sections. These lessons are generally covered in one day during a full time track and over two days in part time tracks. 

There are other resources included in Training Kit including Career Readiness and Principles for Success. Career Readiness focuses on preparing you to be employed in a professional position. Principles for Success focuses on the mindset and motivation needed to accomplish difficult tasks and grow as a professional. 

## Student Progress Report Dashboard
The Lambda School uses a Student Progress Report Dashboard https://dashboards.lambdaschool.com/students/
The same credentials you used to access your training kit can be used to access your dashboard. 

The dashboard is where you as a student can find feedback from the project manager (PM) who reviewed your work. In the top header you'll see your name, section and PM. You will see the sprint challenges that you have completed, the titles, how many attempts it took to pass the sprint and whether it was passed or not. If you need to take another try at a sprint challenge the green box will be red and have the word "resubmit" shown in the box. If you miss submitting a sprint the red box will read "missing"

This dashboard shows you the feedback from your PM on your sprint challenge. It also gives Lambda staff a clear picture of units you may need extra support.

## Google Calendar
Google Calendar is a free time-management and scheduling calendar service developed by Google. It is utilized at Lambda School as the main calendar. You will receive an invite to the Google Calendar for your track. Lambda School operates on Pacific time and takes U.S. holidays. Check the Google Calendar on a regular basis to be sure you are in attendance every day that there is class. 

## Frontdesk
FrontDesk is your way of contacting Lambda School staff with non-classwork related enquiries. This should be your main point of contact for all feedback and if you need support. Frontdesk is accessed through Slack by starting a direct message to yourself and entering /frontdesk. This will open up a screen for you to enter a title and description of the issue you are experiencing. Click submit and a Lambda staff member will reply to your request in Slack.

Frontdesk in meant only for submitting feedback and support requests. If you have classwork related questions go ahead and contact your PM or your class help channel. When asking a question try to give as much detail as possible. Remember to only reply to the threaded messages on your Ticket in the FrontDesk Slack App, that way you can refer to the answers given to you if you forget or have followup questions. Even if you are frustrated, be sure to be professional in all of your interactions with Lambda staff. 

## Applications and Languages Introduced in Pre-work.
It is expected that you have completed the pre-work for your track and passed the challenges before your first day at Lambda School. The material taught in the pre-work is not "busy" work and it may be reviewed but will not be re-taught the first few weeks of class. Be sure that you can access and use the programs and languages to the level that they were introduced in the pre-work.
