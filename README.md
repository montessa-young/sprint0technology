Technology curriculum including technology skills, accessibility policies, privacy policies and links to tutorials. 

# Technology Orientation
Since Lambda School is an online school for training software developers it is expected that you will have advanced skills in using and troubleshooting applications. 

At the end of this module you should be able to:
* Students will install all necessary applications and accessories (speakers/microphone/webcam) to fully participate in Lambda School classes.
* Students will install applications on their mobile devices to ensure continuity of access.
* Students will know how to navigate, personalize and communicate using Slack.
* Students will know how to access and participate fully in Zoom.
* Students will know how to access and navigate Training kit.
* Students will know how to access and navigate the Progress Report Dashboard.
* Students will know how to access and ask a question in Frontdesk.
* Students will know how to use any applications presented during the pre-work for their particular program. 

## System Requirements

* Minimum
 1.6 GHz Processor
 4 GB RAM (8 GB of RAM for the iOS course)
 120 GB Hard Drive
 Web Cam
 Microphone
* Recommended
 2 GHz Processor
 8 GB RAM
 256 GB Hard Drive (preferably solid state)

Recommended operating systems (in descending order): macOS, Windows 10, Ubuntu. For UX and iOS, macOS is heavily encouraged. For iOS, Mojave 10.14 is required.

Other versions of Windows work but students should anticipate occasional environment issues. Chromebooks are *not* supported, as coursework involves installing and running software locally.

_Does your current system meet these standards?_

### Webcam
An external webcam or built-in camera on your computer is recommended to be able to share video with your classmates. It is easier to communicate when you can see nonverbal communication like facial expressions. High definition and feature rich webcams are unnecessary and the basic models will cost approximately $25. 

### Microphone
Some laptops have on-board microphones but it is preferable to have an external microphone. This way it can be positioned properly to ensure your classmates and instructors can hear you clearly. A simple external microphone can be purchased for under $20, with better sound quality coming at higher prices. A headset or headphones with attached microphone also work for this purpose.

### Speakers-Headset-Headphones
The video content does have audio that you will need to listen to. Depending on your study area it may be helpful to have a headset or headphones. 

### Mobile devices
The main communication tools used at Lambda- Slack, Zoom and Notion have mobile applications. If you have a mobile device it would be useful to download these applications to be sure you can communicate in an emergency. The vast majority of the work can not be completed on a mobile device and a fully functional system is required. 

## Technology Skill Prerequisites
It is assumed that you are able to do the following technology tasks as a Lambda School student. If there are any you need to work on, look for online tutorials and brush up on your skills
* Conducting an effective search with a search engine (e.g., Google, Bing, Yahoo) using advanced search commands.
* Evaluating Web resources for authority, currency, purpose, and content
* Understanding copyrights, licenses, and plagiarism in a digital environment
* Installing software
* Updating software
* Running virus scans
* Saving and retrieving files
* Ability to create folders/directories
* Ability to bookmark web pages for future reference
* Ability to play audio and video files
* Familiarity with a word processing, spreadsheet and database program
* Familiarity with a computer operating system (Windows or MacOS)
* Have and use an email account
* Ability to send and receive email attachments
* Ability to troubleshoot basic technology issues

## Accessibility and Privacy Policies
It is Lambda School's intention to make you aware of accessibility tools and understand the privacy policies of the apps that we frequently use since they are from third party vendors. It is recommended that you review their accessibility and privacy policies.

## Slack 
[What is Slack?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g)
Slack is a collaboration hub where you will communicate with everyone at Lambda School. Slack is used because of the following benefits and features not provided by an email system;
* Organized conversations
* Searchable history
* Apps and integrations
Slack can be used as a SaaS, desktop app or mobile app. 
It is vitally important that you are on Slack every school day at Lambda.
